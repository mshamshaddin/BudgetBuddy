/*
Create an application that allows users to enter their 
weekly budget and track how much 
is left based on their purchases throughout the week. 
At a minimum, this should include:
Displaying the userâ€™s weekly budget which will be updated every 
time a new item is added to the list of purchased items.
Allow the user to choose between four categories for each purchase.
    Entertainment
    Food
    Clothing
    Bills	
Must indicate to the user how much money has been spent, 
which requires an easy-to-understand layout.
The user should be able to see how much money 
is being spent on each of the four categories.
If their budget is consumed within the week, 
they must be notified that they cannot purchase additional items.
